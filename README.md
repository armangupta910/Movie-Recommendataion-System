# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview
This repository contains a movie recommendation system that employs multiple machine learning models to provide personalized movie recommendations based on different sets of features. The models used include K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). The recommendation system works based on the Movies Lens dataset containing 100k Ratings.

## Models and Features
The recommendation system utilizes the following models and features:

- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):**
  - **Features:** User ID, Name of the Movie
  - **Description:** Provides recommendations by finding similar users based on movie preferences.

- **Artificial Neural Network (ANN):**
  - **Features:** Genres, Ratings, User Feedback
  - **Description:** Predicts user preferences based on non-linear relationships in movie features and user feedback.

- **Support Vector Machines (SVM):**
  - **Features:** User ID, User Feedback
  - **Description:** Classifies users into different preference groups to suggest movies that match their tastes.

- **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM):**
  - **Features:** User ID
  - **Description:** Clusters users into groups based on their movie watching patterns and preferences.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions to improve the recommendation algorithms or any other aspects of the system. Please follow the standard fork-branch-pull request workflow.
